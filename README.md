# Assisted Vision
<br><br>
Visually impaired individuals often encounter formidable challenges in daily activities, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance their independence and safety. This paper presents an Assisted Vision System designed to address these challenges, deploying the Single Shot Multi box Detector (SSD) algorithm for real-time object detection and 
classification. The system, accessible through a userfriendly web interface built with Flask, provides vocal feedback to aid users in navigating environments, detecting obstacles, locating doors, and retrieving lost objects. Leveraging the capabilities of the SSD algorithm, the proposed system not only improves the efficiency of personal navigation but also holds promise for applications in industrial processes and robotics. The deployment of the project on a web platform enhances accessibility, with start and stop functionalities for user control. This paper details the development, 
implementation, and potential impact of the Assisted Vision System, highlighting its significance in improving the daily experiences of visually impaired individuals and extending its utility to broader contexts.
